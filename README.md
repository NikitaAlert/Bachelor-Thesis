# Bachelor-Thesis
This is the code used for my bachelor thesis: "Generalization of infinitely wide neural networks when learning the thermal Ising model".

The data (the generated configurations X_i) is to big for Github, so it has to be generated with 'Wolff algorithm sampling.ipynb'.

All the jdl2-files are for 'Vorhersagen 2D Ising.ipynb', where the main alalysis takes place.
